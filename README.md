fat-container
=============
**This breaks all sorts of Docker dogma and is full of security best-practice violations.** Basically don't ever use something like this...except when you need something *like* a real-life Linux server running Ubuntu 14.04...purely as *test fixturing* for something else.

Essentially what I wanted here was something like Vagrant but isn't slow as h\*ck to spin up and provision.
